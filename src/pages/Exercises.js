                Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help you keep
                off lost weight. When you take part in physical activity, you
                burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories
                you burn.

              <p className="regular-trips-to">
                Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't
                find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of
                activity is better than none. To gain the benefits of exercise,
                just get more active throughout your day. For example, take the
                stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores.
                Consistency is key.
